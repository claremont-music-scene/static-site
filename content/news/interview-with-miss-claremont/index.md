My introduction to local food and entertainment writer [Miss Claremont](https://www.miss-claremont.com/) was through her post about [great music spots around Claremont](https://www.miss-claremont.com/post/music-in-claremont-ca).  I could feel the enthusiasm dancing off the page as I read through the descriptions and thought this was someone who would be keen on what we are up to.

After a casual chat one afternoon about life and music in Claremont, Rosemary approached me about doing an interview piece and we are both proud to share the result.  Claremont Music is an evolution of ideas about networking people and promoting things that are happening.  We discussed a bit about the motivations that led to the current direction for the organization, as well as ideas about how it can benefit our area.
