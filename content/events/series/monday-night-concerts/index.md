Monday Night Concerts is an annual concert series co-sponsored by the City of Claremont and the Kiwanis Club of Claremont with support from Claremont Lincoln University.
The series features bands playing mainstream hits from a variety of genres: rock, folk, reggae, swing, and pop are a few examples. 

Taking advantage of the concert clamshell 
stage at Memorial Park and the large grassy field, this is a family-friendly environment for all ages. Enjoy the serenity of 
summer sunsets silhouetted by the majestic old-growth trees in the heart of historic Claremont.

Plan Ahead:

* Bring blankets and low chairs.
* Be aware other guests may arrive early.
* Dogs are not allowed in City Parks other than Claremont Pooch Park, Rancho San Jose Park, the Wilderness Park, and the Thompson Creek Trail.
* Alcoholic beverages and smoking are not allowed in any City park.

Many people bring their own
picnic arrangements; there is a concession stand operated by the Kiwanis Club with options for dinner, beverages, and dessert.
