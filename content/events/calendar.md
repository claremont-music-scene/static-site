Over the last few years we have tracked several hundred local music events in our public events calendar. 
This is often tedious work of searching, copying, and pasting from different sources of information, but has 
always been a source of pride in helping to bring visibility to events that you may not have been familiar with.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic the calendar has been put on hold for now.  You can view the archived 
contents [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=claremontmusicscene.com_tesi7gge0tbjslrt4iab7nm00o%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles)

We're looking forward to reviving the calendar (not least of all as a sense of return to some normalcy).  If you'd like
to help out with that effort, or have ideas to share, consider [volunteering for the music scene](/community/volunteering/).
