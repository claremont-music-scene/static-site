Folk Music Center was established in 1958.  Their focus is on providing members of the community with a variety of musical instruments and accessories so that they make their own music.  They offer a look, touch and play experience with instruments from around the world.  Appraisals, repairs and classes are also offered.  The Center also puts on the Folk Music Festival and often features live music performances in the store throughout the year.
