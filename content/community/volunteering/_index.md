The Claremont Music Scene is made possible by a network of like-minded people collaborating together.  This is a central hub where 
you can find and connect with others around shared interests. Maybe you've considered hosting a jam session.  Perhaps you have 
an idea for teaching a class - beginning synth, or make your own junkyard intruments, or have some fun with Steve Reich's 
Clapping. Yes, we can use more drum circles, weekend marching band clubs, and listening parties. How about getting a few 
friends together in the park for some open air karaoke?  
 
 Get the idea?  
 
 Let's go out and create the things we want to see, find places to be creative, and lead by example.

## Want to Help? 

We welcome help and support from any person that acting in a positive and inclusive direction.  If you've done something or 
are working on something related to music in our area, let us know and we will do our best to recognize and share your efforts to the wider
community. We also have a more formalized volunteer program that encourages community members to work on designated projects 
related to directed efforts within the music scene.  

### Music Scene Volunteers

Volunteers propose a project to work on for something they're interested in. (We can help)  You're encouraged to own it and make it 
your own experience.   There's no hard committment but if you can average around one hour per month you'll be considered an
official volunteer.  Volunteers will receive or have access to:

* Seasonal catered meals for recognition and camaraderie
* A stylish T-shirt showing your pride in Claremont Music Scene
* Stickers, decals

### Orientation Meeting Schedule 

To become a volunteer, we ask that you attend a Volunteer Orientation Meeting.  These are casual Zoom meetings that occur a few times 
per month at different times and days of the week in hopes of accommodating people's differing schedules. 

Meetings will last for a maximum of 30 minutes; many may be shorter depending on attendance and extent of open discussion.
