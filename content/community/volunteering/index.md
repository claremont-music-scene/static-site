The Claremont Music Scene is a volunteer effort.

* Outreach Musicians - for organizers and performers interested in bring music to places where people are often dependent directly 
on the help of others for their well being. A few examples being: senior living facilities, veterans' homes, and women's shelters
* Event Planners - for planners, gatherers of people, dreamers, and doers.  Lean on the network of people and information available
to get your idea up and running
* Journalists / Historians / Archivists - Report on local music news, photograph / record events, organize media into collections, help maintain a trove
 of information about local events, venues, education, and people. 
* Education - Create new offerings of community accessible tutoring, classes, regular meetups, seminars, etc.
