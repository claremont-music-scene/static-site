The Claremont Music Scene is made possible by a network of like-minded people collaborating together.  This is a place where you can 
find and connect with others around a shared interest: hosting a jam session, a new open mic event, teaching a class, drum circles, ...
  

* Outreach Musicians - for organizers and performers interested in bring music to places where people are often dependent directly 
on the help of others for their well being. A few examples being: senior living facilities, veterans' homes, and women's shelters
* Event Planners - for planners, gatherers of people, dreamers, and doers.  Lean on the network of people and information available
to get your idea up and running
* Journalists / Historians / Archivists - Report on local music news, photograph / record events, organize media into collections, help maintain a trove
 of information about local events, venues, education, and people. 
* Education - Create new offerings of community accessible tutoring, classes, regular meetups, seminars, etc. 

## Want to Help? 

To become a volunteer, we ask that you attend a Volunteer Orientation Meeting.  These are casual Zoom meetings that occur a few times 
per month at different times and days of the week in hopes of accommodating people's differing schedules.
