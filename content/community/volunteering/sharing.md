As a community project, the Claremont Music Scene depends on the support and contributions of its 
members. 

### Fundraising 

Fundraising and donations will enable the organization to cover operating costs and fund 
new education and outreach programs.  We welcome ideas or help with fundraising, with a goal of 
being transparent about how funds are received and allocated.  

### Outreach

Establish programs to work with local organizations serving (for example):

* Senior and Memory Care Homes
* Veteran's Homes
* Women's Shelters
* Homeless Shelters

For some who cannot access public facilities or events, being able to experience live music in their 
residence is an uplifting gift that someone with almost any musical experience can help provide.
