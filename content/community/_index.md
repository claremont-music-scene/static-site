The Community is where we bring together the different foundational elements that a 
thriving arts and music scene should have: education, supplies, space, and participants. 
Through these lenses we can recognize different pieces of the puzzle such as 
music stores, tutors and teachers, performance and creative venues, musicians, volunteers, and supporters.
